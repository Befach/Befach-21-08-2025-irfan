# üö® Webhook Integration Solution

## ‚úÖ **Problem Fixed**

The main issue was that your Next.js app was configured with `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`, which **completely disables all API routes**. I've removed this configuration.

## üîß **What I've Done**

1. **Fixed Next.js Configuration**
   - Removed `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js`
   - This enables API routes to work properly

2. **Created Direct Webhook Test**
   - Added `/admin/direct-webhook-test` page
   - This tests the Zoho Flow webhook directly from the browser
   - Bypasses API routes to test webhook functionality

3. **Restarted Development Server**
   - The server is now running with API routes enabled

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Test Direct Webhook (Recommended)
1. **Go to**: `/admin/direct-webhook-test`
2. **Click**: "Test Direct Webhook" button
3. **Check**: Browser console for detailed logs
4. **Verify**: Zoho Flow dashboard for incoming data

### Step 2: Test API Routes (After Step 1)
1. **Go to**: `/admin/test-webhook`
2. **Click**: "Test Health" button (should work now)
3. **Click**: "Test Webhook" button (should work now)

### Step 3: Test Real Shipment Creation
1. **Create a new shipment** with a valid email address
2. **Check**: If client receives email notification
3. **Update shipment status** to test stage change notifications

## üìä **Expected Results**

### Direct Webhook Test
```
‚úÖ "Testing direct webhook to Zoho Flow..."
‚úÖ "Sending webhook data: {...}"
‚úÖ "Webhook response status: 200"
‚úÖ "Webhook sent successfully to Zoho Flow"
```

### API Route Test
```
‚úÖ "Testing health endpoint..."
‚úÖ "Health check result: {...}"
‚úÖ "Testing webhook endpoint..."
‚úÖ "Webhook test successful"
```

## üîç **What to Check**

### 1. Browser Console
Look for these success messages:
- Webhook request being sent
- Response status 200
- Success confirmation

### 2. Zoho Flow Dashboard
- Check for incoming webhook data
- Verify the data structure matches expected format
- Look for any error messages

### 3. Email Notifications
- Check if test emails are received
- Verify email templates are working
- Check spam folder if needed

## üö® **If You Still Get Errors**

### CORS Error (if direct webhook fails)
- This is expected for direct browser calls
- Use the API route approach instead
- The server-side API handles CORS properly

### 404 Error (if API routes still fail)
- Make sure you're running `npm run dev`
- Don't use `next export` or static hosting
- Restart the development server

### Zoho Flow Errors
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check if API key is valid
- Ensure webhook is active in Zoho Flow
- Check Zoho Flow service status

## üìù **Data Being Sent to Zoho Flow**

```json
{
  "event_type": "shipment_created",
  "tracking_id": "BEF-TEST-12345",
  "client_email": "test@example.com",
  "shipment_name": "Test Shipment",
  "current_stage": "Product Insurance",
  "origin_country": "Test Origin",
  "destination_country": "Test Destination",
  "estimated_delivery": "2024-12-15",
  "notes": "This is a direct webhook test",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:30:00Z",
  "source": "Befach Shipment Tracker - Direct Test"
}
```

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the direct webhook first** at `/admin/direct-webhook-test`
2. **If that works**, test the API routes at `/admin/test-webhook`
3. **Create a real shipment** to test the full workflow
4. **Configure email templates** in Zoho Flow if needed

The webhook integration should now work properly! Let me know what results you get from the direct webhook test.
